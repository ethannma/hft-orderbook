# High-Frequency Trading OrderBook - Project Summary

## Overview

A high-performance limit order book implementation in modern C++17. This project explores low-latency data structures, matching engine algorithms, and performance optimization techniques used in electronic trading systems.

## Key Achievements

### Performance (Single-threaded, macOS, Clang 17, -O3)
- **Order Insertion**: ~3.0M ops/sec (mean: 0.336 µs, p99: 1.33 µs)
- **Order Cancellation**: ~1.2M ops/sec (mean: 0.812 µs, p99: 1.58 µs)
- **Order Matching**: ~6.4M ops/sec (mean: 0.155 µs, p99: 0.42 µs)
- **Market Depth (10 levels)**: ~12.3M queries/sec (~0.082 µs per query)
- **Best Bid/Ask**: O(1), sub-100ns when hot (below timer resolution)

### Technical Implementation

**Core Features:**
- Price-time priority matching (FIFO within price levels)
- Support for limit and market orders
- Partial fill handling
- Real-time market data queries (best bid/ask, depth, spread)
- Order modification with time priority loss on quantity increases
- Order cancellation

**Data Structures:**
- `std::map` for O(log n) sorted price level access
  - Bids sorted high→low, asks sorted low→high
- `std::deque` for O(1) FIFO order queues at each price
- `std::unordered_map` for O(1) order lookup by ID

**Quality Assurance:**
- 18 comprehensive unit tests using Google Test
- Invariant checking: bid < ask, positive quantities, monotonic trades
- FIFO fill order verification
- Time priority loss validation on order modifications
- Full and partial fill correctness
- Trade price validation (passive order's price)

### Cross-Language Integration

**Python Bindings (pybind11):**
- Full C++ API exposed to Python
- Examples demonstrating usage patterns
- Performance benchmarking suite
- Unit tests in both C++ and Python

## Technical Highlights

- Memory-efficient data structure design
- Cache-aware programming for performance

**Software Engineering:**
- CMake build system with multiple targets
- Comprehensive unit testing (Google Test)
- Cross-language bindings (C++/Python)
- Professional documentation

**Order Book Mechanics:**
- Market microstructure fundamentals
- Price-time priority matching
- Trade execution semantics
- Real-time market data queries

**Performance Engineering:**
- Sub-microsecond latency optimization
- Proper benchmarking methodology
- Percentile-based performance reporting
- Anti-optimization techniques for accurate measurement

## Project Highlights

1. **Real-world relevance**: Implements core data structures used in electronic trading systems
2. **Performance focus**: Sub-microsecond latencies through careful optimization
3. **Professional quality**: Comprehensive testing, documentation, and benchmarking methodology
4. **Domain complexity**: Implements market microstructure concepts and matching rules
5. **Technical depth**: Modern C++, cross-language bindings, build systems, and performance analysis

## Future Enhancements

### Performance Optimizations
- **Intrusive data structures**: Replace `std::deque` with intrusive linked lists to eliminate iterator invalidation overhead
- **Memory pooling**: Per-side free lists to recycle Order objects and defer deallocation
- **Hash map optimization**: Reserve capacity in `unordered_map` to prevent rehashing on hot path
- **Pointer-based operations**: Direct node pointer storage for O(1) cancel without iterator lookup

### Feature Additions
- Lock-free concurrent order book for multi-threaded access
- IOC (Immediate-or-Cancel) and FOK (Fill-or-Kill) explicit test cases
- Stop orders and iceberg orders
- Market maker protection (self-trade prevention)
- FIX protocol integration
- Order book snapshots and replay functionality
